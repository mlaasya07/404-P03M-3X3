Telescopic Love

Admiring him from a distance,
Stealing a glance or two,
Seems enough for the day,
Keeping my small (tiny) heart content,
A smile on his face makes mine magically appear,
Out of nowhere, just like Houdini,
He has my attention and love,
Even if it is not promised to last long,
Even if he doesn't know it,
I'm happy he's happy,
This shall be with me,
Until I make myself worthy of his time and love,
Oh! When my time comes, I will not hesitate,
But all I can do right now,
Is to admire him from a distance,
For how long can something hurt you [again and again]?
As long as you love it with all your heart,
But never be able to hold close to you.

Those accidental touches,
Makes me wish those were longer
